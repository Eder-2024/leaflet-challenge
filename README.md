# 🌍 Leaflet Earthquake Visualization

This project visualizes global earthquake activity using real-time data from the [USGS Earthquake GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). It uses **Leaflet.js** and **D3.js** to display interactive maps and markers that reflect the **magnitude** and **depth** of earthquakes, with additional tectonic plate boundary data overlaid for deeper insight.

## 🔹 Features

- Earthquake markers sized by magnitude and colored by depth
- Interactive popups with magnitude, location, and depth info
- Live data from the past 7 days via USGS GeoJSON API
- Legend showing depth color scale
- Tectonic plate boundaries from [Fraxen's GeoJSON data](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates)
- Layer controls to toggle:
  - Earthquakes
  - Tectonic plates
  - Multiple base maps: Satellite, Grayscale, and Outdoors views

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
- USGS Earthquake GeoJSON Feed
- Mapbox & CartoDB tile layers
